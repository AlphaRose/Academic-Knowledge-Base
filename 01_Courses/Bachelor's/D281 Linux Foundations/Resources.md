They define the scope. Everything else supports them.

## Practice
- [Over The Wire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
- [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-essentials-practice-exams/) I recommend his practice tests not the videos but many swear by his videos.
- [LabEx Linux Jopurney] (https://labex.io/linuxjourney)
- [LabEx Linux] (https://labex.io/learn/linux)
- [KodeCloud](https://kodekloud.com/studio/labs/linux)
- [Practice Test](https://theprimoris.github.io/LPI-Essentials-Practice/) Another Reddit special. Do with it as you please but do not recommend just memorizing things. 

## Documents
- [LPI Linux Essentials Study Guide](https://edu.anarcho-copy.org/GNU%20Linux%20-%20Unix-Like/LPI%20Linux%20Essentials%20Study%20Guide%203rd.pdf)

## Flashcards
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/1023789700/wgu-c851-linux-foundations-flash-cards/) Reddit users claim this was the only thing they studied as the questions are almost identical. I recommend doing more.
